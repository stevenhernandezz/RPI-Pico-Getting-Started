# RPI-Pico-Getting-Started
 This project is used to get familiar with Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller using CPP programming language. It focuses on using on-board peripherals and simulating common embedded systems tasks.
 
## Description
This project contains four parts which are:
 
 * Hello World: Creating a simple "Hello World" program on the Raspberry Pi Pico using standard stdio types.
 * Blink LED: Blink an on board or external LED using General Purpose Input/Output) GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi Pico.
 * Morse Code Tranmitter: Creating a program that blinks an LED on a Raspberry Pi Pico to transmit a string in Morse code.
 * Debouncing Push Buttons: Implementing a debounce which is used to handle input from push buttons and manage the inherent noise in digital inputs.
